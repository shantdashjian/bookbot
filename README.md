## 🤔 Motivation
- 👍 This was my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) Python project! 
- The goal was to practice using core programming building blocks and data structures. 
- You give the program a path to the book text file you want to analyze and it gives you a nice report of word and character count.
